this project uses real moon phase data from Delhi, India from 1901-1910 BCE and visualizes it from the perspective of the sun where the Earth creates a shadow over the moon.

uses maxApi library to talk between sketch.js and a max patch.

the sketch uses Day, Phase, New Moon, Full Moon

sonified elements:
Phase - panning
Az - volume
New Moon and Full Moon will each have a unique sound when 1
(after extending) eclipse will create the most annoying sound I can possibly make
