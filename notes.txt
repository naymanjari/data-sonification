connecting Max/MSP and p5.js:
- in sketch, must call library
const maxAPI = require('max-api');

*error* Uncaught Reference Error: require is not defined

- in Max, must have node object
[node.script sketch.js]

maybe send audio data to the web instead of other way around?

may require a second sketch that recieves data from first sketch to send to max

how to make max patch "run" simultaneously with the sketch
need to be able to recieve data from javascript/jweb to max patch

libraries?
using osc?
websockets? UDP (tester in Max)?
[dict]? https://youtu.be/KjStppG5nq8
